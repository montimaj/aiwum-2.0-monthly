## Summary

The Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US and extracts more than 11 km<sup>3</sup>/year for irrigation activities. The heavy drivers of groundwater use are aquaculture and crops, which include rice, cotton, corn, and soybeans ([Wilson, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20215011)). Consequently, groundwater-level declines in the MAP region ([Clark and others, 2011](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1785)) pose a substantial challenge to water sustainability, and hence, we need reliable groundwater pumping monitoring solutions to manage this resource appropriately.

Here, we first summarize the Aquaculture and Irrigation Water Use Model (AIWUM) 2.0 ([Majumdar and others, 2024a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101674)) and then describe the changes made in AIWUM 2.0 Monthly.

### AIWUM 2.0

In AIWUM 2.0, we used remote sensing datasets and machine learning to improve AIWUM 1.1, previously developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) ([Wilson, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20215011); [Bristow and Wilson, 2023](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9RGZOBZ)). Unlike AIWUM 1.1, which assigned annual irrigation water use per acre based on average water use for each crop type, AIWUM 2.0 integrated remote sensing data in a machine learning framework to produce improved estimates of annual and monthly groundwater use at 1-km spatial resolution.  

By leveraging machine learning, we were able to automatically relate water balance components (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and others) and in-situ groundwater use data, which was not possible before in the MAP. This was the first study to develop a groundwater use estimation model at the field scale by linking the point of use (flowmeter) to the application area (individual fields), which was then used to produce spatially continuous (1-km) groundwater use predictions from 2014-2020. Ultimately, this machine learning-based water-use model is one part of an ongoing USGS effort to build a hydrologic decision-support system specific to the MAP region. Thus, AIWUM 2.0 addressed a critical gap in the hydrologic modeling of this region by introducing a robust machine learning-based method for groundwater use estimation.

Our goal was to include datasets that are correlated to groundwater use, such as remotely sensed evapotranspiration, model-based precipitation estimates, and air temperature. Machine learning provides a more robust method to predict groundwater use than traditional process-based models because these algorithms can handle the complex and often non-linear relationships between explanatory and response variables ([Hastie and others, 2001](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf)). Although the overall approach to predicting groundwater use was similar to our efforts in Kansas ([Majumdar and others, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028059)) and Arizona ([Majumdar and others, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14757)), modeling groundwater use in the MAP region is more complex because of limited metered data availability. Hence, we incorporated additional steps to pre-process the datasets, e.g., linking the flowmeters to the fields using K-Dimensional trees ([Rosenberg, 1985](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.1985.1270098)). We also used more predictors compared to the Kansas and Arizona studies because of the lack of training data and to better explain the scatter in the model predictions.

For AIWUM 2.0, we employed Distributed Random Forests (DRF) ([Breiman, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1010933404324); [Ke and others, 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3294996.3295074)), a distributed ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict annual groundwater use (2014-2020) across the Mississippi embayment (MISE), a large area overlapping the MAP region, using the following datasets as predictors: field centroids (latitude, longitude), SSEBop (Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance) evapotranspiration ([Senay and others, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12057)), precipitation and air temperature from PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Elevation Slopes Model) ([Daly and others, 2008](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/joc.1688)), crop type from the USDA-NASS CDL (US Department of Agriculture- National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer) ([Boryan and others, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2011.562309)), surface runoff and soil moisture change from TerraClimate ([Abatzoglou and others, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.191)), and Soil-Water Balance (SWB) hydrologic soil group (HSG) and irrigation ([Westenbroek and others, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20211008)). 

We relied on the annual groundwater use data provided by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to train and validate our model. The MDEQ collects these crop-specific data through the Delta Voluntary Metering Program (DVMP) and performs quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) checks ([Wilson, 2021](https://doi.org/10.3133/sir20215011)). Crop-specific weights derived from the USGS real-time flowmeter data ([Majumdar and others, 2024b](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CET25K)) were used to disaggregate these annual-scale predictions into monthly timesteps. 

A table summarizing the predictor variables and a diagram of the general processing workflow of AIWUM 2.0 can be found in [Majumdar and others (2024c)](https://doi.org/10.5066/P137FIUZ). For details on the MAP extent and its generalized regions (the Mississippi Delta being one of them), see [Painter and Westerman (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5066/F70R9NMJ) and [Ladd and Travers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5066/P915ZZQM), respectively.  

### Changes in AIWUM 2.0 Monthly

Unlike AIWUM 2.0 which predicts both annual and monthly groundwater use, AIWUM 2.0 Monthly predicts monthly groundwater use at the same 1-km spatial resolution. Here, we aim to incorporate the USGS real-time flowmeter data available across the MAP to disaggegate the annual VMP data into monthly timesteps and increase our training samples. The disaggregation process is described below. See the [IGARSS 2025 poster](poster/IGARSS2025_Poster_SM.pdf) and [Majumdar and others, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS55030.2025.11242748) for further details.

#### Disaggregating VMP data with the real-time weights
For the annual model, we disaggregated with AIWUM 2.0 predictions ([Majumdar and others, 2024b](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CET25K)) with the normalized crop-specific weights derived from the real-time flowmeter data. Here, we apply the same approach as used in [Majumdar and others (2024a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101674) to 
disaggregate the original VMP data. Therefore, we develop monthly VMP data from the annual one and then include the aggregated monthly real-time measurements as well. One caveat of this approach is that 
the disaggregated VMP data do not represent the actual ground truth and can be conceptualized as 'simulated data'.

We use the real-time data (2018-2021) and calculate the normalized weights for each month. We then multiply these weights to the annual VMP data to get the disaggregated annual groundwater use values.

The predictor variables include latitude, longitude, crop type, precipitation, maximum temperature, total evapotranspiration estimated with SSEBop, surface run-off and soil moisture (TerraClimate). Note that, although we do not use the SWB datasets (HSG-derived infiltration rate and irrigation demands) in AIWUM 2.0 Monthly, we have the provision to include these as model predictors in the software. A table summary of the predictor variables for AIWUM 2.0 Monthly is given below.

## Model Results
In this study, we use Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to solve a multi-variate regression problem wherein our target is to predict the monthly groundwater use across the MISE from 2014-2021. The model prediction results are shown [here](AIWUM2_Data/Outputs/LGBM_Results.txt). Note that compared to the AIWUM 2.0 model, the test R2 is higher with lower RMSE and MAE. This is because the disaggregated data using the real-time weights have consistent weights for each month and thus, the model is able to provide better results.
Here we used the [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.5/) ([Ke et al., 2017](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/6449f44a102fde848669bdd9eb6b76fa-Paper.pdf)) Python library to implement the AIWUM 2 model and compared its performance against other algorithms, e.g., Distributed Random Forests (DRF), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), Bagging Trees (BT), AdaBoost Regression (ABR), Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The model comparison is shown below where the metrics are rounded to 3 decimal places (the table is sorted based on the Test RMSE). RMSE was used as the error function in all these models.
